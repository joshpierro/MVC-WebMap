MVC-WebMap
==========

A simple web mapping application built with MVC. To build and launch....
 - Back up the 'GeoCore' data base in the project's App_Data folder
 - Open the solution and configure your web config file (if necessary) 
 
 That's it!


Built with bootstrap, angular.js and leaflet.js. :) 

More features soon.
